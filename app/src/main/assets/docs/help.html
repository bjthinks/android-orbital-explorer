<h3>What atom or element is this?</h3>
<p>Electron orbitals are universal, so the same shapes and patterns occur for all elements. If an
    atom has more electrons, more of these states will be occupied. Orbitals fill up starting from
    the lowest numbered and working generally upward, with space for two electrons per orbital.</p>
<h3>What are the numbers?</h3>
<p>The first number, N, is the electron's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_level">energy level</a> or shell number. The second number,
    <span class="l">l</span>, is the electron's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum">orbital angular momentum</a>, which determines how much
    the electron is rotating around the nucleus, versus oscillating radially. Set
    <span class="l">l</span> to 0 for an "s" orbital, 1 for a "p" orbital, 2 for a "d" orbital, and
    so on. The third number, m, is the z-component of <span class="l">l</span> and affects how the
    electron's orbit is aligned.</p>
<h3>What's the &#x2102; or &#x211d;?</h3>
<p>This button selects which generating set or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)">basis</a> of orbitals to display. The complex or
    "&#x2102;" orbitals each have a well-defined m value, which gives good knowledge of the
    electron's motion. These states are most meaningful for an isolated atom in an external magnetic
    field, and they're often studied in the context of quantum mechanics and solutions to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr&ouml;dinger_equation">Schr&ouml;dinger's equation</a>. The real or "&#x211d;" orbitals are combinations of states with two
    opposite values of m, which gives us more knowledge of the electron's position, but leaves its
    motion less certain. These states are most meaningful when atoms interact with each other, and
    they're often discussed in chemistry.</p>
<h3>How can I view an s, p, d, or f orbital?</h3>
<p>This is determined by the second number, <span class="l">l</span>. Set it to 0 for an s orbital,
    1 for p, 2 for d, and 3 for f. If you also set the &#x2102;/&#x211d; switch to &#x211d;, you
    should get images that match your chemistry reference.</p>
<h3>How might real atoms' orbitals differ from what is shown here?</h3>
<p>The orbitals shown here are accurate for a hydrogen atom (or for an ion like He<sup>+</sup> which
    has a single electron). When there are multiple electrons, their mutual repulsion changes the
    shapes of the orbitals. These interactions are extremely difficult to calculate. Loosely
    speaking, the outer parts of orbitals expand in size due to the screening effect of the other
    electrons, and the orbitals' shapes get distorted slightly so as to keep the electrons farther
    away from each other.</p>
<h3>What do the colors mean and why do they change?</h3>
<p>This app uses color to represent the phase or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number#Polar_form">argument</a> of the electron's wave function. This has no effect on
    the electron's location, but it does show some information about how the electron is moving.</p>
<p>In actual orbitals, the phase is constantly changing. The rate depends on the electron's binding
    energy, which is largest for the inner electrons and decreases for the outer shells. To make color cycling visible, it has been slowed down by a factor of 3 quadrillion from
    what it would be in an actual atom. (For comparison, the size of the atom has been enlarged by
    "only" a factor of about a billion.)</p>

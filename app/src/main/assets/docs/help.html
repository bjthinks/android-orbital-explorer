<h3>What atom is this?</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>What are the numbers?</h3>
<p>The first number, N, is the electron's energy level or shell number. The second number,
    <i>l</i>, is the electron's orbital angular momentum, which determines how much the electron
    is orbiting around the nucleus, versus oscillating radially. Set <i>l</i> to 0 for an "s"
    orbital, 1 for a "p" orbital, 2, for a "d" orbital, and so on. The third number, <i>m</i>,
    is the z-component of <i>l</i> and affects how the electron's orbit is aligned.
<h3>What is the &#x2102; or &#x211d;?</h3>
<p>This button selects which generating set or "basis" of orbitals to display.
    The complex or "&#x2102;" orbitals each have a well-defined <i>m</i> value, which
    maximizes the observer's knowledge of the electron's motion. These states are most
    meaningful for an isolated atom in an external magnetic field, and they are often
    encountered in the context of quantum mechanics and solutions to Schr&ouml;dinger's
    equation. The real or "&#x211d;" orbitals are combinations of states with two
    opposite values of <i>m</i>, which has the effect of localizing the electron's position.
    These states are most meaningful when atoms interact with each other, and they are often
    discussed in chemistry.</p>
<h3>How can I view an s, p, d, or f orbital?</h3>
<p>This is determined by the second number, <i>l</i>. Set it to 0 for an s orbital,
    1 for p, 2 for d, and 3 for f. If you also set the &#x2102;/&#x211d; switch
    to &#x211d;, you should get images that match your chemistry reference.</p>
<h3>How might real atoms' orbitals differ from what is shown here?</h3>
<p>The orbitals shown here are correct for a hydrogen atom (or for an ion like He<sup>+</sup>
    which has a single electron). When there are multiple electrons, their mutual repulsion
    changes the shapes of the orbitals. These interactions are extremely difficult
    to calculate. Loosely speaking, the outer parts of orbitals expand in size due to
    the screening effect of the other electrons, and the orbitals' shapes get distorted
    so as to keep all the electrons farther away from each other.</p>
<h3>What atom is this?</h3>
<p>This app shows electron states, not atoms.
    The element is determined by how many protons an atom has in its nucleus, but orbitals have
    the same shapes regardless of this number. So the simplest answer to this question is, "all
    of them". If you ask which orbitals are <i>filled</i> is more interesting, and depends
    The nuclear charge only affects the size of the orbital,
    causing it to shrink or grow as protons are added or subtracted.
    This app changes the number of protons in the nucleus so that all of the
    orbitals shown are similar in size to each other, which makes it much
    easier to navigate and explore different states. Specifically, sets the number of protons, Z, equal to the energy level, N.
    This simplifies internal calculations, and gives all the orbitals
    the same energy (13.6 eV) and similar radial sizes.</p>
<h3>Why do the colors change?</h3>
<p>Color cycling is a way of visually representing the time dependence of
    the electron's wave function, which is a rotation in the complex plane.
    The rotation speed depends on the electron's energy.
    Since all of the orbitals shown have the same energy, they all cycle colors at
    the same rate. To make this visible to the eye, the cycling rate has been slowed
    down by a factor of 30 quadrillion from what it would be in an actual atom.
    (For comparison, the size of the atom has been enlarged by "only" a factor
    of about one billion).</p>
<h3>How does the rendering work?</h3>
<p>The fragment shader approximates an integral along the line of sight using
    weighted Gaussian quadrature. The quadrature nodes and weights, as well as the
    values of the wave function, are precomputed and stored in
    textures. These textures are all small enough to fit in the fastest level of
    GPU cache. Even so, numeric integration in a fragment shader is expensive,
    so this computation is done on a smaller scale (2dp centers), then interpolated,
    enlarged to screen size, and colored using the CIELUV 1976 perceptual color model.</p>

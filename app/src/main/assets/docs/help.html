<h3>What atom or element is this?</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital">Atomic orbitals</a> are universal, so the same shapes and patterns occur for all elements.
    If an atom has more electrons, more of these states will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configuration">occupied</a>.</p>
<h3>What are the numbers?</h3>
<p>The first number, N, is the electron's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_level">energy level</a> or shell number.
    The second number, <span class="l">l</span>, is the electron's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum">orbital angular momentum</a>, which determines how much the electron is rotating around the nucleus, versus oscillating radially.
    Set <span class="l">l</span> to 0 for an "s" orbital, 1 for a "p" orbital, 2 for a "d" orbital, and so on.
    The third number, m, is the z-component of <span class="l">l</span> and affects how the electron's orbit is aligned.</p>
<h3>What's the &#x2102; or &#x211d;?</h3>
<p>This button selects which generating set or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)">basis</a> of orbitals to display.
    The complex or "&#x2102;" orbitals each have a well-defined m value, which gives good knowledge of the electron's motion.
    These states are most meaningful for an isolated atom in an external magnetic field, and they're often studied in the context of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> and solutions to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr&ouml;dinger_equation">Schr&ouml;dinger's equation</a>.
    The real or "&#x211d;" orbitals are combinations of states with two opposite values of m, which gives us more knowledge of the electron's position, but leaves its motion less certain.
    These states are most meaningful when atoms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond">bond</a> with each other, and they're often discussed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry">chemistry</a>.</p>
<h3>How might real atoms' orbitals differ from what is shown here?</h3>
<p>The orbitals shown here are accurate for a hydrogen atom (or for an ion like He<sup>+</sup> which has a single electron).
    When there are multiple electrons, their mutual repulsion changes the shapes of the orbitals.
    These interactions are extremely difficult to calculate.
    Loosely speaking, the outer parts of orbitals expand outward due to the inner electrons masking some of the nuclear charge, and the orbitals' shapes get distorted slightly so as to keep the electrons farther away from each other.</p>
<h3>What do the colors mean and why do they change?</h3>
<p>This app uses color to represent the phase or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number#Polar_form">argument</a> of the electron's wave function.
    This has no effect on the electron's location, but it does show some information about how the electron is moving.</p>
<p>In actual orbitals, the phase is constantly changing.
    The rate depends on the electron's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_energy">binding energy</a>, which is largest for the inner electrons and decreases for the outer shells.
    To make this visible, time has been slowed down by a factor of 3 quadrillion from what it would be in an actual atom.
    (For comparison, the size of the atom has been enlarged by "only" a factor of about a billion.)</p>

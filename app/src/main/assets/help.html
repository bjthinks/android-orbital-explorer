<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>This app shows the shapes of electron orbitals. An orbital is the volume
    of space that an electron occupies in an atom.</p>
<h3>What are the numbers?</h3>
<p>The numbers determine the quantum state of the electron.
    First is N, the energy level or shell number.
    Second is L, the orbital angular momentum, and
    third is M, the z-projection of angular momentum.</p>
<h3>What is the &#x2102; or &#x211d;?</h3>
<p>This chooses between two different sets of orbitals.
    The complex or "&#x2102;" orbitals have a unique quantum number M, and are most meaningful
    for an isolated atom in an external magnetic field. These orbitals are usually
    discussed in the context of quantum mechanics and solutions to Schr&ouml;dinger's
    equation. The real or "&#x211d;" orbitals are superpositions of states with two
    opposite values of M, and are most meaningful when atoms form bonds with each other.
    These are the orbitals usually discussed in chemistry.</p>
<h3>How can I view an s, p, d, or f orbital?</h3>
<p>This is determined by the second quantum number, L. Set it to 0 for an s orbital,
    1 for p, 2 for d, and 3 for f. If you also set the &#x2102;/&#x211d; switch
    to &#x211d;, you should get pictures that match your chemistry reference.</p>
<h3>Is this what an atom's orbitals really look like?</h3>
<p>Technically, no. The orbitals shown here are only valid for an atom (or ion) with a
    single electron. When there are multiple electrons, their mutual repulsion
    changes the shapes of the orbitals. These interactions are extremely difficult
    to calculate. Loosely speaking, the outer parts of orbitals expand in size due to
    the screening effect of the other electrons, and the orbitals' shapes get distorted
    so as to keep all the electrons farther away from each other.</p>
<h3>What atom is shown?</h3>
<p>Orbitals have the same shape regardless of the number of protons in the
    nucleus. The nuclear charge only affects the size of the orbital,
    causing it to shrink or grow as protons are added or subtracted.
    This app sets the number of protons, Z, equal to the energy level, N.
    This simplifies internal calculations, and gives all the orbitals
    the same energy (13.6 eV) and similar radial sizes.</p>
<h3>Why do the colors change?</h3>
<p>Color cycling is a way of visually representing the time dependence of
    the electron's wave function, which is a rotation in the complex plane.
    The rotation speed depends on the electron's energy.
    Since all of the orbitals shown have the same energy, they all cycle colors at
    the same rate. To make this visible to the eye, the cycling rate has been slowed
    down by a factor of 30 quadrillion from what it would be in an actual atom.
    (For comparison, the size of the atom has been enlarged by "only" a factor
    of about one billion).</p>
<h3>How does the rendering work?</h3>
<p>The fragment shader approximates an integral along the line of sight using
    weighted Gaussian quadrature. The quadrature nodes and weights, as well as the
    values of the wave function, are precomputed and stored in
    textures. These textures are all small enough to fit in the fastest level of
    GPU cache. Even so, numeric integration in a fragment shader is expensive,
    so this computation is done on a smaller scale (2dp centers), then interpolated,
    enlarged to screen size, and colored using the CIELUV 1976 perceptual color model.</p>
